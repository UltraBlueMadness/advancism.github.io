  <h1>ADVANCISM</h1>
  <p>Progress requires sacrifice. Evolution Demands Truth.</p>
  <p>Technology is the vessel through which we elevate the human condition, cure illness, and realise the next stages in human evolution.</p>
  <p>Our purpose is to augment mankind - to expand and deepen our understanding of consciousness and the universe. To do this, we must enable merit indiscriminately, empower experts, and embrace the uncomfortable truth of human nature. And we need to do it now.</p>
  <p>Modern politics is plagued with delusion, identity politics, and intellectual dishonesty. This rigid, absolustis behaviour has polluted the waters of genuine political discourse and obstructed pragmatic progress. It is time to put an end to intellectual tribalism.</p>
  <p>Humanity Must Advance.</p>
