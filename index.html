  <h1>ADVANCISM</h1>
  <p>Progress requires sacrifice. Evolution Demands Truth.</p>
  <p>Technology is the vessel to advance the human condition, cure illness, and realise the next stages in human evolution.</p>
  <p>Our purpose is to augment mankind and our understanding of consciousness and the universe. To do this, we must falicitate and enable merit - indiscriminantly, give power to experts, and embrace the uncomfortable truth of human nature, and we need to do it now.</p>
  <p>Modern politics is plagued with delusion, identity politics, and dogma. This regressive behaviour has blurred and muddied opportunity for progress. It is time to put an end to dishonest intellectual tribalism.</p>
